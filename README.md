This is my first public webpage utilitzing HTML/CSS/JS. 
I have my introduction in a slideshow, an astronomy API, weather API, and a NASA API. If you can't tell, I love anything related to astronomy or science. Also there are my live dev projects that I worked on in there as well. Please tell me what you think!
